# Installation

1. Configure `config.php`.
2. Run `db.sql` with MySQL.
3. Edit everything you need.
4. Rename `htaccess.file` to `.htaccess` (apache only).

## Note
On my website, it's located in a `/ls/` directory, so you might have the folders in `.htaccess`.

## Finish
After you installed the shortener, you can change everything now.
